												As part of a large project with a group of 15 we had an ambitious goal of creating a product where users can 'build' their own city, with children's building blocks as input. 
												I was responsible for making AI which detected and classified the blocks.</font></p>

											<h3>Process</h3>
											<p><font size="4">
												In a duo, we built the detection AI from scratch. We started with researching which
												AI model works best, after some time we ended up picking YOLO as it is perfect for classifying multiple objects in one image.
												Then we went through the tedious process of collecting our own data, which meant taking 200 pictures with blocks randomly
												placed on the table, and then labelling every block in every picture. Up to 30 blocks, with 8 different categories, 
												could be placed at the same time, so this process was extensive.
											</font></p><p><font size="4">
												To save time, we also did data augmentation which was 
												quite tricky, as some forms of data augmentations also resulted in the blocks being placed on another part of the image, 
												which means they also had to be classified differently (the AI model is sensitive to block location). 
												We used the following augmentations: rotation, mirroring, color change, zooming, brightness change. 
												After our model was built, we designed a real-time detection algorithm based on the consecutive-frame consensus method.
												The result was a very accurate real-time model built in the span of 5 days.

											</font></p>

												
											<p><font size="4">
												During this project I refined my python skills and got to work with new AI libraries in python. I also went through the entire 
												practical process of creating an AI: From ideation to data collection and coding, which was a valuable process for me.

												Here you can see the AI in action. As you can see, once I place a block, the corresponding house appears and when I remove a block,
												the house disappears.
