												Meet Flowey! He is a speech-activated candy dispenser with sass. I made him for a project together with a duo.
												When you ask him for a candy very nicely he will give you one, if you're sad he'll even give one extra.
												But if you ask for something else, he won't. And if you ask angrily he will look at you even angrier!
												</font>

											<h3>Process</h3>
											<p><font size="4">
												We went from ideating to having Flowey up-and-running in a little over a week. We started with ideating and settling
												on the idea for a candy experience based on the undertale character Flowey. Then we made a 3d model of the design,
												after we had this we started 3D printing, laser-cutting, cutting, glueing etc. In the meantime, 
												we were also busy with building the speech-detection AI. We started by researching which model would work the best, 
												we picked a CNN+LSTM architecture.
											</p>
											<p>
												We ended up using two models: One for classifying the user's emotion, and one for detecting when the user said "Please give me candy!".
												Then we collected data with over 30 participants to have a diverse dataset. Then we also had to design a real-time detection 
												algorithm, for this we used a sliding moving average.
												We finished the project with testing, which went very well, the AI had a precision of 100% and recall of 95%
												in sentence detection and 80% precision, 75% recall for emotion detection.

												Here you can see Flowey in action. As you can see, when you say random sentences or stay silent, Flowey gives you no candy
												but when you ask specifically "Please give me a candy", he complies.
